## Configure Environment

To start the project create a virtual environment using the `requirements.txt` file. To run the project, open jupyter inside of the root directory and head to the `/notebooks` directory to view all of the notebooks that were used to generate the results. 

```bash
$ python3 -m venv 5156-drone-venv
$ source 5156-drone-venv/bin/activate
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 -m jupyter notebook
```
